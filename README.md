### Machine-Learning
Analysed the Titanic dataset and performed Exploratory Data Analysis. Made use of various machine learning models and hence determined the most accurate model for the given dataset. These models included Logistic regression, KNN-classifier, Decision tree-classifier and Random forest-classifier.
In conclusion, KNN model has the best accuracy among all the models.
